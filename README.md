🚀 I'm a developer who loves learning new things and has a knack for picking up new things pretty quick. I thrive in both solo missions and team projects, and I really enjoy building software that not only meets the customer's wishes but also looks and functions great. I beleive that UI is just as imporatnant as the functionality of the software.
